# Warehouse

The code is in src file.

To make this code work you need to have a MySQL database with name "warehouse" and table named "warehouse_data" in which you need to have 7 columns with names: 
 - name
 - quantity
 - price
 - weight
 - capacity
 - info
 - id
Then you need to check your connections with database so it is working properly. If needed make changes in "user" and "password" when getting connection.
